This project is built to scale, so some of the code functions are not implemented in the hardware. 
In particular, I am reffering to the error lights.

Some features in the 'sketches' folder are redundant:
  - A healthy plant can control the bio cultures of its root space, and therefore we do not need to use sterile water. 
    The sump/filter mechanism was thus removed.
  
  - The drain pipe from the mixing tank is narrow (1/4" OD), and drains much slower than the fill pump.
    The drain-control solenoid was thus removed, and replaced with a manual butterfly valve for ease of maintenance.
    Flow valves just prior to the grow troughs are redundant in an ideal case, but uneven water flow due to system setup keeps them useful.

  - The PVC used as a growing trough causes a few challenges when replacing plants: their roots grow wide, and can entangle + clog up the pipes.    
    The growing container will in the future best be more like a flooded plain than a drainpipe; this also encourages even water distribution across upstream/downstream plants.
    This will require a redesign of the holder mechanisms; see also: "sketches/schematics/framing and mounts.jpg"
